Subject: [PATCH] do not expect ${prefix}/mingw symlink - this should be
 superceded by 0004-Windows-Don-t-ignore-native-system-header-dir.patch .. but
 isn't!

change hardcoded /mingw prefix to the real prefix .. isn't this rubbish?
it might work at build time and could be important there but beyond that?!

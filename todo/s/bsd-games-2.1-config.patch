+.br
+.Nm teachgammon
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
+or against a "friend".
+All commands only are one letter,
+so you don't need to type a carriage return,
+except at the end of a move.
+The program is mostly self documenting,
+so that a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
+If you answer `y' when the program asks if you want the rules,
+you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
+some hints on strategy,
+instruction on how to use the program,
+and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
+A description of how to use the program can be
+obtained by answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.
+.Pp
+The possible arguments for backgammon
+(most are unnecessary but some are very convenient)
+consist of:
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Fl n
+don't ask for rules or instructions
+.It Fl r
+player is red (implies n)
+.It Fl w
+player is white (implies n)
+.It Fl b
+two players, red and white (implies n)
+.It Fl pr
+print the board before red's turn
+.It Fl pw
+print the board before white's turn
+.It Fl pb
+print the board before both player's turn
+.It Fl t Ar term
+terminal is type
+.Ar term ,
+uses
+.Pa /usr/share/misc/termcap
+.It Fl s Ar file
+recover previously saved game from
+.Ar file .
+(This can also be done by executing the saved file,
+i.e., typing its name in as a command)
+.El
+.Pp
+.\" 
+.\" Arguments may be optionally preceded by a `-'.
+.\" Several arguments may be concatenated together,
+.\" but not after `s' or `t' arguments,
+.\" since they can be followed by an arbitrary string.
+Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.
+An argument of a lone `-' gets a description of possible arguments.
+.Pp
+If
+.Ar term
+has capabilities for direct cursor movement (see
+.Xr termcap 5 )
+.Nm backgammon
+``fixes'' the board after each move,
+so the board does not need to be reprinted,
+unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.
+Also, any `p' option will be ignored.
+(The `t' option is not necessary unless the terminal type does not match
+the entry in the 
+.Pa /usr/share/misc/termcap 
+data base.)
+.Sh QUICK REFERENCE
+When the program prompts by typing only your color,
+type a space or carriage return to roll, or
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Ic d
+to double
+.It Ic p
+to print the board
+.It Ic q

+.Nm cfscores
+.Nd the solitaire card game canfield
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm
+.Nm cfscores 
+.Op Fl a
+.Op Ar user
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+If you have never played solitaire before, it is recommended
+that you consult a solitaire instruction book. In
+Canfield, tableau cards may be built on each other downward
+in alternate colors. An entire pile must be moved as a unit
+in building. Top cards of the piles are available 
+to be played on foundations, but never into empty spaces.
+.Pp
+Spaces must be filled from the stock. The top card of
+the stock also is available to be played on foundations or
+built on tableau piles. After the stock is exhausted,
+tableau spaces may be filled from the talon and the player may
+keep them open until he wishes to use them.
+.Pp
+Cards are dealt from the hand to the talon by threes
+and this repeats until there are no more cards in the hand
+or the player quits. To have cards dealt onto the talon the
+player types 
+.Sq Ic ht 
+for his move. Foundation base cards are
+also automatically moved to the foundation when they become
+available.
+.Pp
+The command 
+.Sq Ic c
+causes
+.Nm
+to maintain card counting statistics
+on the bottom of the screen. 
+When properly used this can greatly increase one's chances of 
+winning.
+.Pp
+The rules for betting are somewhat less strict than
+those used in the official version of the game.
+The initial deal costs $13.
+You may quit at this point or inspect the game.
+Inspection costs $13 and allows you to make as many
+moves as possible without moving any cards from your hand
+to the talon.
+(The initial deal places three cards on the talon;
+if all these cards are used,
+three more are made available.)
+Finally, if the game seems interesting,
+you must pay the final installment of $26.
+At this point you are
+credited at the rate of $5 for each card on the foundation;
+as the game progresses you are credited with $5 for each
+card that is moved to the foundation.
+Each run through the hand after the first costs $5.
+The card counting feature
+costs $1 for each unknown card that is identified.
+If the information is toggled on,
+you are only charged for cards
+that became visible since it was last turned on.
+Thus the maximum cost of information is $34.
+Playing time is charged at a rate of $1 per minute.
+.Pp
+With no arguments, the program
+.Nm cfscores
+prints out the current status of your canfield account.
+If a 
+.Ar user
+name is specified,
+it prints out the status of their canfield account.
+If the
+.Fl a
+flag is specified,
+it prints out the canfield accounts for all users that have
+played the game since the database was set up.

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm cribbage
+.Nd the card game cribbage
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm
+.Op Fl eqr
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+plays the card game cribbage, with the program playing one hand
+and the user the other.  The program will initially ask the user if
+the rules of the game are needed \- if so, it will print out
+the appropriate section from
+.Em According to Hoyle
+with
+.Xr more 1 .
+.Pp
+.Nm
+options include:
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Fl e
+When the player makes a mistake scoring his hand or crib, provide an
+explanation of the correct score.  (This is especially useful for
+beginning players.)
+.It Fl q
+Print a shorter form of all messages \- this is only recommended for
+users who have played the game without specifying this option.
+.It Fl r
+Instead of asking the player to cut the deck, the program will randomly
+cut the deck.
+.El
+.Pp
+.Nm
+first asks the player whether he wishes to play a short game (
+.Dq once around ,
+to 61) or a long game (
+.Dq twice around ,
+to 121).  A
+response of 
+.Sq Ic s
+will result in a short game, any other response will
+play a long game.
+.Pp
+At the start of the first game, the program
+asks the player to cut the deck to determine who gets the
+first crib.  The user should respond with a number between 0 and
+51, indicating how many cards down the deck is to be cut.  The player
+who cuts the lower ranked card gets the first crib.
+If more than one game is played, the
+loser of the previous game gets the first crib in the current game.
+.Pp
+For each hand, the program first prints the player's hand,
+whose crib it is, and then asks the player
+to discard two cards into the crib.  The cards are prompted for
+one per line, and are typed as explained below.
+.Pp
+After discarding, the program cuts the deck (if it is the player's
+crib) or asks the player to cut the deck (if it's its crib); in the latter
+case, the appropriate response is a number from 0 to 39 indicating
+how far down the remaining 40 cards are to be cut.
+.Pp
+After cutting the deck, play starts with the non-dealer (the person
+who doesn't have the crib) leading the first card.
+Play continues, as per cribbage, until all cards are exhausted.  The
+program keeps track of the scoring of all points and the total of
+the cards on the table.
+.Pp
+After play, the hands are scored.  The program requests the player to
+score his hand (and the crib, if it is his) by printing out the
+appropriate cards (and the cut card enclosed in brackets).
+Play continues until one player reaches the game limit (61 or 121).
+.Pp
+A carriage return when a numeric input is expected is equivalent
+to typing the lowest legal value; when cutting the deck this
+is equivalent to choosing the top card.
+.Pp
+Cards are specified as rank followed by suit.  The ranks may be specified
+as one of:
+.Sq a ,
+.Sq 2 ,
+.Sq 3 ,
+.Sq 4 ,
+.Sq 5 ,
+.Sq 6 ,
+.Sq 7 ,
+.Sq 8 ,
+.Sq 9 ,
+.Sq t ,
+.Sq j ,
+.Sq q ,
+and
+.Sq k ,
+or alternatively, one of:
+.Sq ace ,
+.Sq two ,
+.Sq three ,
+.Sq four ,
+.Sq five ,
+.Sq six ,
+.Sq seven ,
+.Sq eight ,
+.Sq nine ,
+.Sq ten ,
+.Sq jack ,
+.Sq queen ,
+and 
+.Sq king .
+Suits may be specified as: 
+.Sq s ,
+.Sq h ,
+.Sq d ,
+and
+.Sq c ,
+or alternatively as:
+.Sq spades ,
+.Sq hearts ,
+.Sq diamonds ,
+and
+.Sq clubs .
+A card may be specified as: 
+.Dq Ao rank Ac \  Aq suit ,
+or: 
+.Dq Ao rank Ac of Aq suit .
+If the single letter rank and suit designations are used, the space
+separating the suit and rank may be left out.  Also, if only one card
+of the desired rank is playable, typing the rank is sufficient.
+For example, if your hand was 
+.Dq 2H, 4D, 5C, 6H, JC, and KD
+and it was desired to discard the king of diamonds, any of 
+the following could be typed:
+.Sq k ,
+.Sq king ,
+.Sq kd ,
+.Sq k d ,
+.Sq k of d ,
+.Sq king d ,
+.Sq king of d ,
+.Sq k diamonds ,
+.Sq k of diamonds ,
+.Sq king diamonds ,
+.Sq king of diamonds .

+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+is a program used to regulate game playing.
+.Nm
+expects to be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to play.
+This is done by creating symbolic links to
+.Nm dm ,
+in the directory
+.Pa /usr/games
+for all of the regulated games.
+The actual binaries for these games should be placed in a
+.Dq hidden
+directory,
+.Pa /usr/libexec/dm ,
+that may only be accessed by the
+.Nm
+program.
+.Nm
+determines if the requested game is available and, if so, runs it.
+The file
+.Pa /etc/dm.conf
+controls the conditions under which games may
+be run.
+.Pp
+The file
+.Pa /etc/nogames
+may be used to
+.Dq turn off
+game playing.
+If the file exists, no game playing is allowed; the contents of the file
+will be displayed to any user requesting a game.

+Two problems result from

+running the games setuid
+.Dq games .
+First, all games that allow users to run
+.Tn UNIX
+commands should carefully
+set both the real and effective user id's immediately before executing
+those commands.  Probably more important is that
+.Nm
+never be setuid
+anything but
+.Dq games
+so that compromising a game will result only in
+the user's ability to play games at will.  Secondly, games which previously
+had no reason to run setuid and which accessed user files may have to
+be modified.

+.Nd \&dm configuration file
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+The
+.Xr dm.conf
+file
+is the configuration file for the
+.Xr \&dm 8
+program.
+It consists of lines beginning with one of three keywords, ``badtty'',
+``game'', and ``time''.  All other lines are ignored.
+.Pp
+Any tty listed after the keyword ``badtty'' may not have games played on
+it.
+Entries consist of two white-space separated fields: the string
+``badtty'' and the ttyname as returned by
+.Xr ttyname 3 .
+For example,
+to keep the uucp dialout, ``tty19'', from being used for games, the
+entry would be:
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+badtty	/dev/tty19
+.Ed
+.Pp
+Any day/hour combination listed after the keyword ``time'' will disallow
+games during those hours.  Entries consist of four white-space separated
+fields: the string ``time'', the unabbreviated day of the week and the
+beginning and ending time of a period of the day when games may not be
+played.  The time fields are in a 0 based, 24-hour clock.  For example,
+the following entry allows games playing before 8AM and after 5PM on
+Mondays.
+.Bd -literal -offset indent
+time		Monday	8	17
+.Ed
+.Pp
+Any game listed after the keyword ``game'' will set parameters for a specific
+game.  Entries consist of five white-space separated fields: the keyword
+``game'', the name of a game, the highest system load average at which the
+game may be played, the maximum users allowed if the game is to be played,
+and the priority at which the game is to be run.  Any of these fields may
+start with a non-numeric character, resulting in no game limitation or
+priority based on that field.  The game "default" controls the settings for
+any game not otherwise listed, and must be the last ``game'' entry in the
+file.  Priorities may not be negative.  For example, the following entries
+limits the game ``hack'' to running only when the system has 10 or less
+users and a load average of 5 or less; all other games may be run any time
+the system has 15 or less users.

+If it is, there will be a

+percent probability that an adage will be picked from that file
+or directory.
+If the percentages do not sum to 100, and there are specifications
+without percentages, the remaining percent will apply to those files

+.SH NAME
+hunt \- a multi-player multi-terminal game
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fB/usr/games/hunt\fP [ \fB\-qmcsfbS\fP ] [ \fB\-n\fP name ] [ \fB\-t\fP team ] [ \fB\-p\fP port ] [ \fB\-w\fP message ] [ host ]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The object of the game
+.I hunt
+is to kill off the other players.
+There are no rooms, no treasures, and no monsters.
+Instead, you wander around a maze, find grenades, trip mines, and shoot down
+walls and players.
+The more players you kill before you die, the better your score is.
+If the
+.B \-m
+flag is given,
+you enter the game as a monitor
+(you can see the action but you cannot play).
+.PP
+.I Hunt
+normally looks for an active game on the local network;
+if none is found, it starts one up on the local host.
+The location of the game may be specified by giving the
+.I host
+argument.
+This presupposes that a hunt game is already running on that host, see
+.IR huntd (6)
+for details on how to setup a game on a specific host.
+If more than one game if found,
+you may pick which game to play in.
+.PP
+If the
+.B \-q
+flag is given,
+.I hunt
+queries the local network (or specific host)
+and reports on all active games found.
+This is useful for shell startup scripts, \fIe.g.\fP csh's .login.
+.PP
+The player name may be specified on the command line by using the
+.B \-n
+option.
+.PP
+The
+.BR \-c ,
+.BR \-s ,
+and
+.B \-f
+options are for entering the game cloaked, scanning, or flying respectively.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-b
+option turns off beeping when you reach the typeahead limit.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-t
+option aids team playing by making everyone else on one's team
+appear as the team name.
+A team name is a single digit to avoid conflicting with other characters
+used in the game.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-p
+.I port
+option allows the rendezvous port number to be set.
+This is a useful way for people playing on dialup lines to avoid playing
+with people on 9600 baud terminals.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-w
+.I message
+option is the only way to send a message to everyone else's screen when
+you start up.
+It is most often used to say ``eat slime death - NickD's coming in''.
+.PP
+When you die and are asked if you wish to re-enter the game,
+there are other answers than just yes or no.
+You can also reply with a
+.B w
+for write a message before continuing or
+.B o
+to change how you enter the game (cloaked, scanning, or flying).
+.PP
+To be notified automatically when a
+.I hunt
+starts up, add your login to the
+.I hunt-players
+mailing list (see
+.IR huntd (6)).
+.SH "PLAYING HINTS"
+.I Hunt
+only works on crt (vdt) terminals with at least 24 lines, 80 columns, and
+cursor addressing.
+The screen is divided in to 3 areas.
+On the right hand side is the status area.
+It shows damage sustained,
+charges remaining,
+who's in the game,
+who's scanning (the
+.B ``*''
+in front of the name),
+who's cloaked (the
+.B ``+''
+in front of the name),
+and other players' scores.
+The rest of the screen is taken up by your map of the maze.
+The 24th line
+is used for longer messages that don't fit in the status area.
+.PP
+.I Hunt
+uses the same keys to move as
+.IR vi (1)
+does,
+.IR i.e. ,
+.BR h ,
+.BR j ,
+.BR k ,
+and
+.B l
+for left, down, up, right respectively.
+To change which direction you're facing in the maze,
+use the upper case version of the movement key (\c
+.IR i.e. ,
+.BR HJKL ).
+You can only fire or throw things in the direction you're facing.
+.TP
+Other commands are:
+.sp
+.nf
+.ta
+.ta \w'>\|<\|^\|v\ \ 'u
+f or 1	\- Fire a bullet (Takes 1 charge)
+g or 2	\- Throw grenade (Takes 9 charges)

+7	\- Throw even more big bomb (Takes 169 charges)
+8	\- Throw even more bigger bomb (Takes 225 charges)
+9	\- Throw very big bomb (Takes 289 charges)
+0	\- Throw very, very big bomb (Takes 361 charges)
+@	\- Throw biggest bomb (Takes 441 charges)

+.MP
+You can only fire in the direction you are facing.
+.MP
+You can only fire three shots in a row, then the gun must cool off.
+.MP
+Shots move 5 times faster than you do.
+.MP
+To stab someone,
+you face that player and move at them.
+.MP
+Stabbing does 2 points worth of damage and shooting does 5 points.
+.MP
+Slime does 5 points of damage each time it hits.
+.MP
+You start with 15 charges and get 5 more every time a player enters
+or re-enters.
+.MP
+Grenade explosions cover a 3 by 3 area, each larger bomb cover a
+correspondingly larger area (ranging from 5 by 5 to 21 by 21).
+All explosions are centered around the square the shot hits and
+do the most damage in the center.
+.MP
+Slime affects all squares it oozes over.
+The number of squares is equal to the number of charges used.
+.MP
+One small mine and one large mine is placed in the maze for every new player.
+A mine has a 2% probability of tripping when you walk forward on to it;
+50% when going sideways;
+95% when backing up.
+Tripping a mine costs you 5 points or 10 points respectively.
+Defusing a mine is worth 1 charge or 9 charges respectively.
+.MP
+You cannot see behind you.
+.MP
+Cloaking consumes 1 ammo charge per 20 of your moves.
+.MP
+Scanning consumes 1 ammo charge per (20 \(mu the number of players)
+of other player moves.
+.MP
+Turning on cloaking turns off scanning \(em turning on scanning turns off
+cloaking.
+.MP
+When you kill someone,
+you get 2 more damage capacity points and 2 damage points get taken away.
+.MP
+Maximum typeahead is 5 characters.
+.MP
+A shot destroys normal (\c
+.IR i.e., 
+non-diagonal, non-door) walls.
+.MP
+Diagonal walls deflect shots and change orientation.
+.MP
+Doors disperse shots in random directions (up, down, left, right).
+.MP
+Diagonal walls and doors cannot be destroyed by direct shots but may
+be destroyed by an adjacent grenade explosion.
+.MP
+Slime goes around walls, not through them.
+.MP
+Walls regenerate, reappearing in the order they were destroyed.
+One percent of the regenerated walls will be diagonal walls or doors.
+When a wall is generated directly beneath a player, he is thrown in
+a random direction for a random period of time.  When he lands, he
+sustains damage (up to 20 percent of the amount of damage already
+sustained);
+.IR i.e. ,
+the less damage he had, the more nimble he is and
+therefore less likely to hurt himself on landing.
+.\"MP
+.\"There is a volcano close to the center of the maze which goes off
+.\"close to every 30 deaths.
+.MP
+Every 30 deaths or so, a
+.B ``?''
+will appear.
+It is a wandering bomb which will explode when it hits someone, or
+when it is slimed.
+.MP
+If no one moves, everything stands still.
+.MP
+The environment variable
+.B HUNT
+is checked to get the player name.
+If you don't have this variable set,
+.I hunt
+will ask you what name you want to play under.
+If you wish to set other options than just your name,
+you can enumerate the options as follows:
+.br
+.ti +1i
+setenv HUNT "name=Sneaky,team=1,cloak,mapkey=zoFfGg1f2g3F4G"
+.br
+sets the player name to Sneaky,
+sets the team to one,
+sets the enter game attribute to cloaked,
+and the maps \fBz\fP to \fBo\fP, \fBF\fP to \fBf\fP, \fBG\fP to \fBg\fP,
+\fB1\fP to \fBf\fP,
+\fB2\fP to \fBg\fP, \fB3\fP to \fBF\fP, and \fB4\fP to \fBG\fP.
+The \fImapkey\fP option must be last.
+Other options are: scan, fly, nobeep, port=string, host=string,
+and message=string \(em which correspond to the command line options.
+String options cannot contain commas since commas
+are used to separate options.
+.MP
+It's a boring game if you're the only one playing.
+.PP
+Your score is the decayed average of the ratio of number of kills to number
+of times you entered the game and is only kept for the duration
+of a single session of \fIhunt\fP.
+.PP
+.I Hunt
+normally drives up the load average to be approximately
+(number_of_players + 0.5) greater than it would be without a
+.I hunt 
+game executing.
+.SH STATISTICS
+The
+.B \-S
+option fetches the current game statistics.
+The meaning of the column headings are as follows:
+.I score
+\(em the player's last score;
+.I ducked
+\(em
+how many shots a player ducked;
+.I absorb
+\(em how many shots a player absorbed;

+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+.I huntd
+controls the multi-player
+.IR hunt (6)
+game.
+When it starts up, it tries to notify all members of the
+.I hunt-players
+mailing list (see
+.IR sendmail (8))
+by faking a
+.IR talk (1)
+request from user ``Hunt Game''.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-s
+option is for running

+forever (server mode).
+This is similar to running it under the control of
+.I inetd
+(see below),
+but it consumes a process table entry when no one is playing.
+.PP
+The
+.B \-p
+option changes the udp port number used to rendezvous with the player
+process and thus allows for private games of hunt.
+This option turns off the notification of players on the
+.I hunt-players
+mailing list.
+.SH INETD

+.Sh NAME
+.Nm monop
+.Nd Monopoly game
+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm /usr/games/monop
+.Op Ar file
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm Monop
+is reminiscent of the Parker Brother's game Monopoly, and
+monitors a game between 1 to 9 users.
+It is assumed that the rules of Monopoly are known.
+The game follows the standard rules, with the exception that,
+if a property goes up for auction and there are only two solvent players,
+no auction is held and the property remains unowned.
+.Nm
+The game, in effect, lends the player money,
+so it is possible to buy something which you cannot afford.
+However, as soon as a person goes into debt,
+he must 
+.Dq fix the problem ,
+.Em i.e. ,
+make himself solvent, before play can continue.
+If this is not possible, the player's property reverts to his debtee,
+either a player or the bank.
+A player can resign at any time to any person or the bank,
+which puts the property back on the board, unowned.
+.Pp
+Any time that the response to a question is a
+.Em string ,
+e.g., a name, place or person, you can type 
+.Sq Ic ?
+to get a list of valid answers.
+It is not possible to input a negative number, nor is it ever necessary.
+.Pp
+.Em A Summary of Commands :
+.Bl -tag -width item
+.It Ic quit
+quit game: This allows you to quit the game.  It asks you if you're sure.
+.It Ic print
+print board: This prints out the current board.

+.Em number
+of the owner of the property.
+.It Price
+The cost of the property (if any)
+.It Mg
+This field has a 
+.Sq *
+in it if the property is mortgaged
+.It \&#
+If the property is a Utility or Railroad, this is the number
+of such owned by the owner.
+If the property is land, this is the number of houses on it.
+.It Rent
+Current rent on the property.  If it is not owned, there is no rent.
+.El
+.It Ic where
+where players are: Tells you where all the players are.
+A `*' indicates the current player.
+.It Ic own holdings
+List your own holdings,
+.Em i.e. ,
+money, get-out-of-jail-free cards, and property.
+.It Ic holdings
+holdings list: Look at anyone's holdings.
+It will ask you whose holdings you wish to look at.
+When you are finished, type 
+.Sq Ic done .
+.It Ic mortgage
+mortgage property:
+Sets up a list of mortgageable property, and asks which you wish to mortgage.
+.It Ic unmortgage
+unmortgage property:
+Unmortgage mortgaged property.
+.It Ic buy
+buy houses:
+Sets up a list of monopolies on which you can buy houses.
+If there is more than one, it asks you which you want to buy for.
+It then asks you how many for each piece of property,
+giving the current amount in parentheses after the property name.
+If you build in an unbalanced manner
+(a disparity of more than one house within the same monopoly),
+it asks you to re-input things.
+.It Ic sell
+sell houses:
+Sets up a list of monopolies from which you can sell houses.
+It operates in an analogous manner to
+.Ic buy.
+.It Ic card
+card for jail:
+Use a get-out-of-jail-free card to get out of jail.
+If you're not in jail, or you don't have one, it tells you so.
+.It Ic pay
+pay for jail:
+Pay $50 to get out of jail, from whence you are put on Just Visiting.
+Difficult to do if you're not there.
+.It Ic trade
+This allows you to trade with another player.
+It asks you whom you wish to trade with,
+and then asks you what each wishes to give up.
+You can get a summary at the end, and, in all cases,
+it asks for confirmation of the trade before doing it.
+.It Ic resign
+Resign to another player or the bank.
+If you resign to the bank, all property reverts to its virgin state,
+and get-out-of-jail free cards revert to the deck.
+.It Ic save
+save game:
+Save the current game in a file for later play.
+You can continue play after saving,
+either by adding the file in which you saved the game after the

+It will ask you which file you wish to save it in,
+and, if the file exists, confirm that you wish to overwrite it.
+.It Ic restore
+restore game:
+Read in a previously saved game from a file.
+It leaves the file intact.
+.It Ic roll
+Roll the dice and move forward to your new location.  
+If you simply hit the <RETURN> key instead of a command,
+it is the same as typing
+.Ic roll .

+The

+utility tests your knowledge of random facts.
+It has a database of subjects from which you can choose.
+With no arguments,
+.Nm
+displays the list of available subjects.

+The options are as follows:

+.It Fl t
+Use tutorial mode, in which questions are repeated later if you didn't get
+them right the first time, and new questions are presented less frequently
+to help you learn the older ones.
+.It Fl i
+Specify an alternative index file.
+.El
+.Pp
+Subjects are divided into categories.
+You can pick any two categories from the same subject.
+.Nm
+will ask questions from the first category and it expects answers from
+the second category.
+For example, the command ``quiz victim killer'' asks questions which are
+the names of victims, and expects you to answer with the cause of their
+untimely demise, whereas the command ``quiz killer victim'' works the
+other way around.
+.Pp
+If you get the answer wrong,
+.Nm
+lets you try again.

+The index and data files have a similar syntax.
+Lines in them consist of several categories separated by colons.
+The categories are regular expressions formed using the following
+meta-characters:
+.sp
+.Bl -tag -width "pat|pat" -compact -offset indent
+.It pat|pat
+alternative patterns
+.It {pat}
+optional pattern
+.It [pat]
+delimiters, as in pat[pat|pat]pat
+.El
+.Pp
+In an index file, each line represents a subject.
+The first category in each subject is the pathname of the data file for
+the subject.
+The remaining categories are regular expressions for the titles of each
+category in the subject.
+.Pp
+In data files, each line represents a question/answer set.
+Each category is the information for the question/answer for that category.
+.Pp
+The backslash character (``\e'') is used to quote syntactically significant
+characters, or at the end of a line to signify that a continuation line
+follows.
+.Pp
+If either a question or its answer is empty,
+.Nm
+will refrain from asking it.
+.Sh FILES
+.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/games/quiz -compact
+.It Pa /usr/share/games/quiz
+The default index and data files.
+.El
+.Sh BUGS
+.Nm

+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm
+.Op Fl sjta
+.Op Ar scorefile
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+pits you against evil robots, who are trying to kill you (which is why
+they are evil).
+Fortunately for you, even though they are evil, they are not very bright
+and have a habit of bumping into each other, thus destroying themselves.
+In order to survive, you must get them to kill each other off, since you
+have no offensive weaponry.
+.Pp
+Since you are stuck without offensive weaponry, you are endowed with one
+piece of defensive weaponry: a teleportation device.
+When two robots run into each other or a junk pile, they die.
+If a robot runs into you, you die.
+When a robot dies, you get 10 points, and when all the robots die,
+you start on the next field.
+This keeps up until they finally get you.
+.Pp
+Robots are represented on the screen by a
+.Sq \+ ,
+the junk heaps from their collisions by a
+.Sq \(** ,
+and you
+(the good guy)
+by a
+.Sq \@ .
+.Pp
+The commands are:

+.It Ic k
+move one square up
+.It Ic j

+.It Ic HJKLBNYU
+run as far as possible in the given direction
+.It Ic \>
+do nothing for as long as possible
+.It Ic t
+teleport to a random location
+.It Ic w
+wait until you die or they all do
+.It Ic q
+quit
+.It Ic ^L
+redraw the screen
+.El
+.Pp
+All commands can be preceded by a count.
+.Pp
+If you use the
+.Sq Ic w 
+command and survive to the next level, you will get a bonus of 10%
+for each robot which died after you decided to wait.
+If you die, however, you get nothing.
+For all other commands, the program will save you from typos
+by stopping short of being eaten.
+However, with
+.Sq Ic w
+you take the risk of dying by miscalculation.
+.Pp
+Only five scores are allowed per user on the score file.
+If you make it into the score file, you will be shown the list at the end
+of the game.
+If an alternative score file is specified, that will be used instead of the
+standard file for scores.
+.Pp
+The options are
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Fl s
+Don't play, just show the score file.
+.It Fl j
+Jump,
+.Em i.e. ,
+when you run, don't show any intermediate positions; only show things at
+the end.
+This is useful on slow terminals.
+.It Fl t
+Teleport automatically when you have no other option.
+This is a little disconcerting until you get used to it, and then it is
+very nice.
+.It Fl a
+Advance into the higher levels directly, skipping the lower, easier levels.

+.Op Fl w Ar width
+.Op Fl l Ar length
+.br
+.Nm snscore
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+.Nm
+is a display-based game which must be played on a CRT terminal.
+The object of the game is to make as much money as possible without
+getting eaten by the snake.  The
+.Fl l
+and
+.Fl w
+options allow you to specify the length and width of the field.
+By default the entire screen (except for the last column) is used.
+.Pp
+You are represented on the screen by an I.
+The snake is 6 squares long and is represented by S's.
+The money is $, and an exit is #.
+Your score is posted in the upper left hand corner.
+.Pp
+You can move around using the same conventions as 
+.Xr vi 1 ,
+the
+.Ic h ,
+.Ic j ,
+.Ic k ,
+and
+.Ic l
+keys work, as do the arrow keys.
+Other possibilities include:
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Ic sefc
+These keys are like hjkl but form a directed pad around the d key.
+.It Ic HJKL
+These keys move you all the way in the indicated direction to the
+same row or column as the money.  This does 
+.Em not
+let you jump away from the snake, but rather saves you from having
+to type a key repeatedly.  The snake still gets all his turns.
+.It Ic SEFC
+Likewise for the upper case versions on the left.
+.It Ic ATPB
+These keys move you to the four edges of the screen.
+Their position on the keyboard is the mnemonic, e.g.
+P is at the far right of the keyboard.
+.It Ic x
+This lets you quit the game at any time.
+.It Ic p
+Points in a direction you might want to go.
+.It Ic w
+Space warp to get out of tight squeezes, at a price.
+.El
+.Pp
+To earn money, move to the same square the money is on.
+A new $ will appear when you earn the current one.
+As you get richer, the snake gets hungrier.
+To leave the game, move to the exit (#).
+.Pp
+A record is kept of the personal best score of each player.
+Scores are only counted if you leave at the exit,
+getting eaten by the snake is worth nothing.
+.Pp
+As in pinball, matching the last digit of your score to the number
+which appears after the game is worth a bonus.
+.Pp
+To see who wastes time playing snake, run
+.Nm snscore .

+.Sh BUGS
+When playing on a small screen,
+it's hard to tell when you hit the edge of the screen.
+.Pp
+The scoring function takes into account the size of the screen.
+A perfect function to do this equitably has not been devised.

+.Sh SYNOPSIS
+.Nm
+.Op Fl s
+.Op Fl k Ar keys
+.Op Fl l Ar level
+.Sh DESCRIPTION
+The
+.Nm
+command runs display-based game which must be played on a CRT terminal.
+The object is to fit the shapes together forming complete rows,
+which then vanish.
+When the shapes fill up to the top, the game ends.
+You can optionally select a level of play, or custom-select control keys.
+.Pp
+The default level of play is 2.
+.Pp
+The default control keys are as follows:
+.Pp
+.Bl -tag -width "<space>" -compact -offset indent
+.It j
+move left
+.It k
+rotate 1/4 turn counterclockwise
+.It l
+move right
+.It <space>
+drop
+.It p
+pause
+.It q
+quit
+.El
+.Pp
+The options are as follows:
+.Bl -tag -width indent
+.It Fl k
+The default control keys can be changed using the
+.Fl k
+option.
+The
+.Ar keys
+argument must have the six keys in order, and, remember to quote any
+space or tab characters from the shell.
+For example:
+.sp
+.Dl "tetris -l 2 -k 'jkl pq'"
+.sp
+will play the default games, i.e. level 2 and with the default
+control keys.
+The current key settings are displayed at the bottom of the screen
+during play.
+.It Fl l
+Select a level of play.
+.It Fl s
+Display the top scores.
+.El
+.Pp
+.Sh PLAY
+At the start of the game, a shape will appear at the top of the screen,
+falling one square at a time.
+The speed at which it falls is determined directly by the level:
+if you select level 2, the blocks will fall twice per second;
+at level 9, they fall 9 times per second.
+(As the game goes on, things speed up,
+no matter what your initial selection.)
+When this shape
+.Dq "touches down"
+on the bottom of the field, another will appear at the top.
+.Pp
+You can move shapes to the left or right, rotate them counterclockwise,
+or drop them to the bottom by pressing the appropriate keys.
+As you fit them together, completed horizontal rows vanish,
+and any blocks above fall down to fill in.
+When the blocks stack up to the top of the screen, the game is over.
+.Sh SCORING
+You get one point for every block you fit into the stack,
+and one point for every space a block falls when you hit the drop key.
+(Dropping the blocks is therefore a good way to increase your score.)
+Your total score is the product of the level of play
+and your accumulated
+.ie t points\(em200
+.el points -- 200
+points on level 3 gives you a score of 600.
+Each player gets at most one entry on any level,
+for a total of nine scores in the high scores file.
+Players who no longer have accounts are limited to one score.
+Also, scores over 5 years old are expired.
+The exception to these conditions is that the highest score on a given
+level is
+.Em always
+kept,
+so that following generations can pay homage to those who have
+wasted serious amounts of time.
+.Pp
+The score list is produced at the end of the game.
+The printout includes each player's overall ranking,
+name, score, and how many points were scored on what level.
+Scores which are the highest on a given level
+are marked with asterisks
+.Dq * .

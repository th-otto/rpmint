%description
p7zip is a quick port of 7z.exe and 7za.exe (command line version of
7zip, see www.7-zip.org) for Unix. 7-Zip is a file archiver with
highest compression ratio. Since 4.10, p7zip (like 7-zip) supports
little-endian and big-endian machines.

This package provides:
  * %{_bindir}/7zr - a light stand-alone executable that supports only 7z/LZMA/BCJ/BCJ2 archives
  * %{_bindir}/p7zip - a gzip-like wrapper around 7zr

This package provides:
 * %{_bindir}/7z - uses plugins to handle many types of archives
 * %{_bindir}/7za - a stand-alone executable (handles less archive formats than 7z)

This package allows e.g. File Roller or Ark to create/extract 7z archives.
